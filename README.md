 Fundamentals of Data Analytics (EDA) - Minor Project 1

 Overview
This project focuses on exploring and analyzing a dataset containing information about books, with the goal of recommending good books to readers of all types. By performing descriptive statistics and graphical analysis, we aim to understand the dataset's characteristics and answer specific questions related to book popularity, authorship, ratings, and page counts.

 Dataset
The dataset used for this project is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks?select=books.csv). It includes details about various books, such as title, author, publication year, average rating, number of pages, and publisher.

 Objectives
- Explore the dataset using descriptive statistics and graphical summaries.
- Answer specific questions to derive insights about book popularity, authorship, and more.
- Present findings through a compelling data story, incorporating both verbal and visual elements.

 Key Questions to Answer
1. What is the most popular book?
2. Are books with fewer pages rated higher than those with large page counts?
